* What is this?

This is my (Jeremiah Peschka) emacs configuration. It's loosely based on other
configurations that I have found delightful and clear, but not suited to my use
for one reason or another. 

* Why "corgmacs"?

I have a corgi. He's rad.

I also have another dog who is also rad. However he is of no discernable breed.

* How should you install this?

You probably shouldn't. But if you want to give it a shot, you can:

#+begin_src shell
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.old
git clone git@github.com:peschkaj/corgmacs.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src
